## 🏢 About ProseAI
ProseAI is a legal technology organization dedicated to increasing access to justice for self-represented litigants in family court. Their primary mission involves developing reliable, AI-driven legal tools that provide accurate information while mitigating the risks of hallucinations and improper citations that can cause significant harm in legal proceedings.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
In this project, you will use a frozen benchmark of AI-generated legal documents and a fixed corpus of Alaska family-law statutes, court rules, and case citations and natural language processing techniques — citation parsing, existence checking, and quote-fidelity comparison using string and semantic similarity — to build a system that detects hallucinated legal citations: references to laws or cases that do not exist, or that misquote the source. This will help our company address the risk that AI-generated legal documents contain hallucinated or inaccurate citations, which can cause real harm to self-represented litigants in family court.

### Success Criteria

How Success Is Measured

The guiding principle: this project succeeds by producing a rigorous, honest measurement of the system, not by the system achieving a good score. A detector that reveals a high hallucination rate is a successful project, because surfacing the truth is precisely its purpose. The fellows are graded on the quality of their measurement and analysis, never on how well ProSe AI's generated documents happen to perform.

Success is measured across three components and one overarching criterion.

**Part A — Citation Extraction & Existence Checking.** Success is a working pipeline that reliably parses a document, extracts every statute and case citation, and correctly separates real citations from fabricated ones against the frozen answer key. The measure is correctness and reproducibility — high extraction recall (few citations missed) and accurate existence classification — not any particular number, but a trustworthy result the tool produces on demand, including on benchmark documents it processed for the first time.

**Part B — Quote-Fidelity & Detection Metrics.** Success is measured by how well the full detector distinguishes clean documents from corrupted ones. The team computes precision, recall, and F1 on the planted errors across the frozen benchmark, prioritizing recall on fabricated citations, since a missed fabrication is the most consequential error. The quote-fidelity checker should correctly flag altered or misquoted legal text using string and semantic similarity. The deeper measure of quality is honest error analysis — a clear account of *which* kinds of hallucinations the detector catches and which it misses, assembled into a categorized failure taxonomy.

**Part C — Improvement Recommendations.** Success is measured by actionability. Each recommendation should be specific, ranked by its severity to user outcomes, and tied directly to evidence from Parts A and B. The bar: a reader can tell from each recommendation exactly what to change and why it matters. "Fidelity checker misses paraphrased holdings — recall drops to 0.55 on altered quotes versus 0.9 on fabricated citations; add paraphrase-aware matching" passes; "improve the checker" does not.

**Overarching criterion: reusability.** The ultimate measure of success is whether ProSe AI can re-run the complete detector against an updated version of the document-generation system after the project ends and obtain a trustworthy before-and-after comparison without the fellows present. The strategic purpose of this project is a permanent quality gate and standing regression suite — not a one-time report. If that re-run is possible in January, the project has delivered its lasting value regardless of how any individual metric came out.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Foundation & Citation Extraction | • Explore the frozen benchmark and citation corpus: document structure, citation patterns, statute vs. case-law references.<br>• Build the citation extractor: parse a document and pull out every statute reference and case citation as structured data.<br>• Measure extraction recall against the answer key and analyze what gets missed.<br>• **Deliverable:** Citation extractor module + extraction-accuracy report against the answer key. |
| October | Existence & Quote-Fidelity Verification | • Build the existence checker: verify whether each extracted citation actually appears in the corpus, flagging fabrications.<br>• Build the quote-fidelity checker: compare quoted holding/statute text to the true source using string and semantic similarity.<br>• Combine both into a per-document hallucination-risk score and tune the flagging thresholds.<br>• **Deliverable:** Existence + fidelity verification modules with tuned thresholds. |
| November | End-to-End Detection & Failure Analysis | • Run the full detector across the frozen benchmark of clean and deliberately-corrupted documents.<br>• Compute detection metrics — precision, recall, F1 — against the planted errors, prioritizing recall on fabricated citations.<br>• Analyze failure cases (missed fabrications, false alarms) and categorize them into a failure taxonomy; assemble a regression set.<br>• **Deliverable:** End-to-end hallucination detector + evaluation notebook + categorized failure taxonomy. |
| December | Packaging, Final Report & Presentation | • Synthesize results into prioritized findings and recommendations.<br>• Package the detector as a clean, documented Python module with a simple API and a reproducible evaluation notebook.<br>• Present findings and recommendations to ProSe AI stakeholders.<br>• **Deliverable:** Final report (PDF) + open-source detection library (GitHub) + prioritized recommendations + presentation slides. |

## 📊 Dataset

**Name and Source:** 
The project uses a frozen, labeled benchmark assembled by ProSe AI from public Alaska family-law sources. It has three parts: (1) a **citation corpus** — the real text of Alaska statutes and rules of civil procedure covering domestic relations (custody, child support, protective orders), plus real Alaska family-law case citations drawn from CourtListener (the Free Law Project's public database); (2) a **labeled document benchmark** of 200 AI-generated legal documents built with fictional party names, where roughly half are clean and half contain deliberately planted errors (fabricated citations and altered quotes); and (3) an **answer key** marking every citation in every document as real or fabricated, and every quote as faithful or altered. The statutes, rules, and opinions are public record with no personally identifiable information, and all sample documents use fictional parties.

**How it will be shared:**
ProSe AI will deliver the benchmark pre-processed and frozen before the program begins, as structured files (JSON (answer key, manifest) + JSONL (corpus) + DOCX (the documents themselves)) plus a data dictionary defining every field, the label schema, how the corrupted documents were generated, and known limitations. Because the benchmark is fixed, the team works against a stable, reproducible target from day one — every evaluation run is deterministic. The pre-trained embedding and cross-encoder models the team uses are free and public on Hugging Face; no paid services or vector index are required. If the team chooses to regenerate sample documents (optional — the benchmark ships pre-generated), ProSe AI will provide the necessary API keys at no cost.

## 🛠️ Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** * Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transfer Learning / Pre-trained Models (Deep Learning / Neural Networks if the re-ranker stretch goal is attempted)


**Recommended Libraries:**
- pandas — load and manipulate the benchmark documents and citation corpus
- sentence-transformers — embed quoted passages and source text for semantic fidelity checks 
- rapidfuzz — fast string comparison for citation existence lookups and quote matching
- scikit-learn — precision/recall/F1 and threshold tuning against the answer key

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Precision / Recall / F1 on hallucination detection against the answer key — recall on fabricated citations prioritized, since a missed fabrication is the most consequential error
- Citation extraction recall — the share of true citations the parser pulls from each document
- Quote-fidelity accuracy — how often the semantic similarity check correctly separates faithful quotes from altered ones
